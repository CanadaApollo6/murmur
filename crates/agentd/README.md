# agentd

Library-only broker slice. `model`, `swarm` and `mailroom` provide the durable
mailbox and task ledger. `supervisor::Broker` runs one actor per registered agent.
Claude and Codex use ACP subprocesses. No executable broker, MCP or RAP surface,
Infinity adapter, services, or graph UI is included.

## Broker API

- `Broker::new(mailroom, kinds, config)` configures ACP kinds and crash policy.
  `KindConfig::claude(path)` selects `default`; `KindConfig::codex(path)` selects
  `read-only`. Both set the mode after new and loaded sessions, before prompting.
  Arguments, environment, MCP server entries and sandbox arguments are configurable.
  `KindConfig::cancel_timeout` bounds prompt completion after cancel (default two
  seconds). Expiry crashes and reaps the session, settling mail by start evidence.
- `spawn(AgentSpec)` registers an agent and returns an `AgentHandle`. A second
  actor for that ID is rejected, including through another broker sharing storage.
  Specs and kind definitions are supplied again when reopening the broker.
- `send(NewMessage)` accepts durable mail, then nudges the recipient. Sender
  identity is trusted in this in-process API; surfaces must authenticate it later.
  Human mail is user input. Peer mail carries the labelled `<agent-message>`
  framing. Idle delivery batches all queued envelopes in arrival order.
- `AgentHandle::{cancel,pending_permissions,answer_permission,phase,phases,stop}`
  control or observe an actor. Answers include the request's incarnation.
  Rules match an exact normalized tool name, or `*`; the first match wins.
  No rule means escalate to the caller. An optional timeout rejects once, or
  cancels if the agent provides no single-use rejection option.
- `events()` returns a bounded display-only broadcast receiver. Subscribers can
  lag; SQLite remains delivery authority. Activity never becomes agent input.
- `shutdown()` stops and reaps sessions, settles outstanding delivery, and waits
  for the actors to release storage. Call it before closing the mailroom.

`Phase` covers Dormant, Starting, Idle, Busy, Suspending, Ended, Crashed, Failed,
and NeedsRecovery. Busy agents never receive another turn. Five crashes in ten
minutes stop retries; backoff doubles from one second to a 60-second cap.
A failed resume enters NeedsRecovery without creating a fresh conversation.
Only resumable agents suspend on idle timeout. `None` on the spec inherits the
kind's timeout; `None` on the kind disables idle suspension.

The private adapter contract opens or resumes a session, submits turns, cancels,
answers permissions, receives normalized events and suspends. Resume tokens are
opaque persisted data. Prompt completion produces Committed, the only event
that consumes mail. A first execution update, permission request or prompt completion
records turn-start evidence. Only agent message/thought chunks, plans and tool
calls/updates count as execution updates; metadata and user echoes do not.
Protocol errors produce no receipt.

## Mailroom API

`Mailroom::open(path, Config::default()).await` opens a real SQLite file in WAL
mode with full synchronous commits. One dedicated thread owns the connection.
An exclusive SQLite lock rejects a second owner, including another process.
Methods enqueue a transaction and await its result without blocking Tokio.
Cancelling the caller after submission does not cancel the transaction. Retry
`accept` with the same sender and client key to recover its original result.
Call `close().await` to drain submissions, join the thread, and release the file.
Dropping the handle also drains submissions, but does not wait for thread exit.

- `model` exports ULID identities, validated names and bodies, recipients,
  senders, incarnations, immutable envelopes, delivery states and delivery class.
- `swarm` exports the five acts, outcomes with evidence and artifacts, tasks,
  states, stakes, budgets, epochs and exposure types.
- `Mailroom` registers and resolves minimal agents, accepts and reads messages,
  and reads conversation views.
- Delivery operations are `pending_for`, `delivery`, `mark_offered`,
  `mark_started`, `mark_consumed`, `session_ended`, `held`, `release`,
  `drop_held` and `retire`.
- Ledger operations are `task`, `record_spend`, `new_epoch` and `exposures`.
  A Request creates its task inside `accept`; there is no separate creation path.
- `Interceptor`, `Verdict`, `ConversationView`, `HopLimit`, `Config` and typed
  outcomes and errors describe the acceptance and storage boundary.

Only IDs returned in `OfferOutcome::offered` may be submitted to a session.
`mark_consumed` and `mark_started` require the offered incarnation. Unknown IDs,
wrong incarnations, duplicate IDs in a batch and illegal source states fail the
whole batch. Repeating an offer under the same incarnation, or a receipt for
mail already consumed, succeeds without changing anything. Session cleanup and
retirement select only eligible rows, so repeating cleanup changes nothing.

The first five offers are allowed by default. A sixth offer attempt moves Queued
to Held without submitting it or incrementing the counter. An operator release
resets attempts to zero. This grants another bounded set of attempts.

Private actor storage persists kind, incarnation and resume token. Startup
settles offers from the previous incarnation before opening a process. Offers
with durable turn-start evidence become Uncertain; others return to Queued.
The live actor lease remains held across idle suspension and crash backoff.

## Verification

`cargo test -p agentd` runs SQLite tests and subprocess integration tests.
`agentd-fake-acp` is a scriptable test fixture binary, not a broker executable.
`python3 crates/agentd/scripts/check-mutations.py` requires behavioral failures
when guarantees are removed, then requires each restored test to pass.

The ignored `live_claude_acp` and `live_codex_acp` tests use logged-in shims at
`AGENTD_CLAUDE_ACP` and `AGENTD_CODEX_ACP`. Run them with
`cargo test -p agentd --test supervisor live_ -- --ignored --nocapture`.
They verify a first turn, idle suspension, session load and remembered context.
See [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md) for scope decisions and evidence.
